Title: PacMen Project
Description:In this project we created web page that produces a PacMan on the click of a button by using array methods and using new techniques of manipulating the Document Object Modeling(DOM).
How to run & Road Map: 
To use setInterval we will need to structure the function in a different way from when we used setTimeout with the video. Instead of passing in two arguments to setTimeout, we will pass four arguments to setInterval. The first extra one is called pos, which stands for position, and is already set at 0 on line 2. The second extra argument is pageWidth, which is calculated for us on line 3.
The starter code included will help to get up and running. The starter code we see on the right contains the following items:
images folder: This folder contains the images representing Pac-Man at different stages (mouth open, mouth closed).
index.html: This is the HTML file that displays Pac-Man.
pacman.js: This contains the PacMan animation JavaScript starter code.
